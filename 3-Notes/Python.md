## **Introduction**

you can use `"".join` to join character together
and can use `chr()` to convert number to text **using ASC II**
and can use `ord()` to do the opposite thing

### socket
the first thing you should do is making object , 
`obj = socket.socket(arg1,arg2)` for example you can use this socket.AF_INET(this use for ipv4) for arg 1 and socket.SOCK_STREAM for TCP connection 
then connect this , with `connect()` and it take one arg so you need to put another () if there's 2 arg and need to put them as one
and can use `socket.SOCK_DGRAM` fro UDP connection and in UDP you do not need `connect()` because UDP is less-connection(it do not do connect to the target) it send the data with `sendto(b"",(ip,port))` then you can use this 
`data, addr = recvform(4096)`  in normal it receve data and address in this way `(b"somedata"),(192.168.0.1,9994)` but if we use `data,addr` way data will receve `b""` and addr will receve `(192.168.0.1,9994)` then in the end of both of those (UDP , TCP ) use `print(data.decode())` to write the data then close it by `client.close()`

**i will write only the new things or what i always forget it**
## EASY

### TWO-SUM
to solve this you need to use indeces and for that you caan use this:
`for i in (len(nums))` 
and youu need to use instaaed **for loop** 

like this:
```python
for i in (len(nums)):
	for j in range(i+1,len(nums))
```

**range(first, n)** here start from **first** and end with **n-1** which mean if **first = 0** and **n = 5** this is mean it will be like this **\[0,1,2,3,4]**
### ROMAN-TO-INTEGER
we use dict and this is the sol
```python
class Solution(object):
    def romanToInt(self, s):
        d = {'I':1, 'V':5, 'X':10, 'L':50, 'C':100, 'D':500, 'M':1000}
        total = 0 
        i = 0
        while i < len(s):
            # if there's a next character and current < next -> subtractive pair
            if i + 1 < len(s) and d[s[i]] < d[s[i+1]]:
                total += d[s[i+1]] - d[s[i]]
                i += 2      # skip the next character because we already used it
            else:
                total += d[s[i]]
                i += 1
        return total
```

## strings
you can let every first char from your message is upper case by `message.title()`
and can let every chr is upper case by `message.upper()` or lower `message.lower`

`\n` mean new line
`\t` mean tab, and it space if there's no space and start of line if it with `\n`

`.strip` it function use to remove whitespace from both side of a word for exampl `' python '` will be `'python'` after using it , and there's **`.lstrip`** for left only and **`.rstrip`** for right only 

`.removeprefix()` which will remove anything you want **e.g. `https://example.com`** you use it like this `url.removeprefix('https//')` and it will be removed and be **`example.com`** but only if it start with it , if it end it with it like `file.txt` then will need `removesuffix('.txt')` which will remove it 

## list

### introduction 
you can introduce this by [] like `list = ['anything', 1, 'ali']` and as you say it can have **strings** and **integers** and it start from zero until ...  
you can print it by the index of what you want like `print(list[0])` which will print `anything` 
you can access last one in list by `print(list[-1])` which will write `ali` and you continue like this , `-2` will be the one before last one and `-3` is the third but from end and so on 

### changing and adding
you can change element in list in this way `list[0] = 'nothing'` 
and to add  a completely new one in the end , do this `list.append('tah')`
and if you want  to add a new one but in specific position , do this `list.insert(0,'woow')` now it will be in the first and you can control the index 
This operation shifts every other value in the list one position to the right.
###  removing
you can remove any element by using this `del list[0]` 
and you remove the last one by this `list.pop()` which will remove the last one
and you can use `pop()` to remove any element in any position`list.pop(2)` it will remove the   third element    
the different here between `del` and `pop()` is the same  in removing but `del` will remove an element completely and `pop()` can be sigh  the removed element to a variable like this  `removeELEMENT = list.pop()` that's right it will remove it from  the list but it will sign to the variable 
Sometimes you wonâ€™t know the position of the value you want to remove
from a list. If you only know the value of the item you want to remove, you
can use `list.remove('ali')`
#### list.remove()
it use to remove element by its value not its position
