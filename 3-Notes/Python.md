# **Introduction**

you can use `"".join` to join character together
and can use `chr()` to convert number to text **using ASC II**
and can use `ord()` to do the opposite thing

## socket
the first thing you should do is making object , 
`obj = socket.socket(arg1,arg2)` for example you can use this socket.AF_INET(this use for ipv4) for arg 1 and socket.SOCK_STREAM for TCP connection 
then connect this , with `connect()` and it take one arg so you need to put another () if there's 2 arg and need to put them as one
