Authentication vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data and functionality. They also expose additional attack surface for further exploits.

## What is authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client. Websites are potentially exposed to anyone who is connected to the internet. This makes robust authentication mechanisms integral to effective web security.

There are three main types of authentication:

- Something you **know**, such as a password or the answer to a security question. These are sometimes called "knowledge factors".
- Something you **have**, This is a physical object such as a mobile phone or security token. These are sometimes called "possession factors".
- Something you **are** or do. For example, your biometrics or patterns of behavior. These are sometimes called "inherence factors".

## What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

Authentication is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be. Authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something.
For example, authentication determines whether someone attempting to access a website with the username `Carlos123` really is the same person who created the account.

Once `Carlos123` is authenticated, their permissions determine what they are authorized to do. For example, they may be authorized to access personal information about other users, or perform actions such as deleting another user's account.

## Vulnerabilities arise?

Most vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms occur in one of two ways:

- The authentication mechanisms are weak because they fail to adequately protect against brute-force attacks.
- Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the authentication mechanisms to be bypassed entirely by an attacker. This is sometimes called "broken authentication".

In many areas of web development, logic flaws cause the website to behave unexpectedly, which may or may not be a security issue. However, as authentication is so critical to security, it's very likely that flawed authentication logic exposes the website to security issues.

## Vulnerabilities in password-based login
### Brute-force attacks

A brute-force attack is when an attacker uses a system of trial and error to guess valid user credentials. These attacks are typically automated using word lists of usernames and passwords. Automating this process, especially using dedicated tools, potentially enables an attacker to make vast numbers of login attempts at high speed.

Brute-forcing is not always just a case of making completely random guesses at usernames and passwords. By also using basic logic or publicly available knowledge, attackers can fine-tune brute-force attacks to make much more educated guesses. This considerably increases the efficiency of such attacks. Websites that rely on password-based login as their sole method of authenticating users can be highly vulnerable if they do not implement sufficient brute-force pro

**some labs** sometimes brute-forcing have really big logic flaw which lead to account take over
like some tell you if the username is the wrong or the password , which is big mistake from the website like if the username is wrong tell you `username is wrong` and if the password was wrong will tell you `password is wrong`

but some of them fix this by telling you every time `username or password is wrong.`
you can try to input true username and see what will happened and when i do this , this is what happened `usernamme or password is wrong` it the same but not it is not , there is no `.` in the end which mean it different response and this is logic flew lead to brute force 

and some of them depaend of the time of the responce

some time if you try to sign in 3 times and all of them are fails the website will block you for some minute  but if you try to sign in 2 times and fails then sign in for the 3 time was correct the counter of attempt will reset which will be logic flaw because you can do 2 random sign in (to get the victim account) then sign in with your account and by this you can make brute force 



## Vulnerabilities in multi-factor authentication
Many websites rely exclusively on single-factor authentication using a password to authenticate users. However, some require users to prove their identity using multiple authentication factors.

first vulnerability you may face is you can bypass 2 factor authentication by just drop the request of  2FA , for example you sign in after that it ask for 2FA you can just drop the request (using burp) then go to your account page and it will let you in
