Authentication vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data and functionality. They also expose additional attack surface for further exploits.

## What is authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client. Websites are potentially exposed to anyone who is connected to the internet. This makes robust authentication mechanisms integral to effective web security.

There are three main types of authentication:

- Something you **know**, such as a password or the answer to a security question. These are sometimes called "knowledge factors".
- Something you **have**, This is a physical object such as a mobile phone or security token. These are sometimes called "possession factors".
- Something you **are** or do. For example, your biometrics or patterns of behavior. These are sometimes called "inherence factors".

## What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

Authentication is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be. Authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something.
For example, authentication determines whether someone attempting to access a website with the username `Carlos123` really is the same person who created the account.

Once `Carlos123` is authenticated, their permissions determine what they are authorized to do. For example, they may be authorized to access personal information about other users, or perform actions such as deleting another user's account.

## Vulnerabilities arise?

Most vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms occur in one of two ways:

- The authentication mechanisms are weak because they fail to adequately protect against brute-force attacks.
- Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the authentication mechanisms to be bypassed entirely by an attacker. This is sometimes called "broken authentication".

In many areas of web development, logic flaws cause the website to behave unexpectedly, which may or may not be a security issue. However, as authentication is so critical to security, it's very likely that flawed authentication logic exposes the website to security issues.
