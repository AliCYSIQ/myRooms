## RECON 
 start with this [writup](https://medium.com/@ibtissam1/how-i-found-100-vulnerabilities-using-just-recon-81133da385d3)
find sub-domains or any leak in java-script files is very good and you could find bugs only throw it 
ONE of ways to find `js` files is this 
==`echo “example.com” | gau | grep .js | httpx -mc 200`==

subdomains that could have some **miss configuration**(the most thing i should focus on while do RECON)
