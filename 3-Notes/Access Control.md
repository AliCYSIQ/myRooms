## What is access control?

**Access control** is the application of constraints on who or what is authorized to perform actions or access resources. In the context of web applications, access control is dependent on authentication and session management:

- **Authentication** confirms that the user is who they say they are.
- **Session management** identifies which subsequent HTTP requests are being made by that same user.
- **Access control** determines whether the user is allowed to carry out the action that they are attempting to perform.

### Vertical access controls

Vertical access controls are mechanisms that restrict access to sensitive functionality to specific types of users.
