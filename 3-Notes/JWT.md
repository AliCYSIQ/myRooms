## What are JWTs?

JSON web tokens (JWTs) are a standardized format for sending cryptographically signed JSON data between systems. They can theoretically contain any kind of data, but are most commonly used to send information ("claims") about users as part of authentication, session handling, and access control mechanisms.

### JWT format

A JWT consists of 3 parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. These are each separated by a dot, as shown in the following example:

```

```
The header and payload parts of a JWT are just base64url-encoded JSON objects. The header contains metadata about the token itself, while the payload contains the actual "claims" about the user. For example, you can decode the payload from the token above to reveal the following claims:

```
{"iss": "portswigger", "exp": 1648037164, "name": "Carlos Montoya", "sub": "carlos", "role": "blog_author", "email": "carlos@carlos-montoya.net", "iat": 1516239022 }
```

In most cases, this data can be easily read or modified by anyone with access to the token. Therefore, the security of any JWT-based mechanism is heavily reliant on the cryptographic signature.

### JWT signature

The server that issues the token typically generates the signature by hashing the header and payload. In some cases, they also encrypt the resulting hash. Either way, this process involves a secret signing key. This mechanism provides a way for servers to verify that none of the data within the token has been tampered with since it was issued:

- As the signature is directly derived from the rest of the token, changing a single byte of the header or payload results in a mismatched signature.
    
- Without knowing the server's secret signing key, it shouldn't be possible to generate the correct signature for a given header or payload.

###### **If you want to gain a better understanding of how JWTs are constructed, you can use the debugger on `jwt.io` to experiment with arbitrary tokens.**

sometimes all you need to exploit it , just changing token in it like if you find `"sub": "carlos"`
change it to `"sub": "Victim-name"` and see what will happen

in some application it will refuse this because of signature  you can try to change `"arg":"RSA256"` to `"arg":"none"` which will let it pass it without verify the signature 

## Brute-forcing secret keys

Some signing algorithms, such as HS256 (HMAC + SHA-256), use an arbitrary, standalone string as the secret key. Just like a password, it's crucial that this secret can't be easily guessed or brute-forced by an attacker. Otherwise, they may be able to create JWTs with any header and payload values they like, then use the key to re-sign the token with a valid signature.

When implementing JWT applications, developers sometimes make mistakes like forgetting to change default or placeholder secrets. They may even copy and paste code snippets they find online, then forget to change a hardcoded secret that's provided as an example. In this case, it can be trivial for an attacker to brute-force a server's secret using a [wordlist of well-known secrets](https://github.com/wallarm/jwt-secrets/blob/master/jwt.secrets.list).

## JWT header parameter injections

According to the JWS specification, only the `alg` header parameter is mandatory. In practice, however, JWT headers (also known as JOSE headers) often contain several other parameters. The following ones are of particular interest to attackers.

- `jwk` (JSON Web Key) - Provides an embedded JSON object representing the key.
    
- `jku` (JSON Web Key Set URL) - Provides a URL from which servers can fetch a set of keys containing the correct key.
    
- `kid` (Key ID) - Provides an ID that servers can use to identify the correct key in cases where there are multiple keys to choose from. Depending on the format of the key, this may have a matching `kid` parameter.
    

As you can see, these user-controllable parameters each tell the recipient server which key to use when verifying the signature. In this section, you'll learn how to exploit these to inject modified JWTs signed using your own arbitrary key rather than the server's secret.

### Injecting self-signed JWTs via the jwk parameter

The JSON Web Signature (JWS) specification describes an optional `jwk` header parameter, which servers can use to embed their public key directly within the token itself in JWK format.

#### JWK

A JWK (JSON Web Key) is a standardized format for representing keys as a JSON object.

You can see an example of this in the following JWT header:

`{ "kid": "ed2Nf8sb-sD6ng0-scs5390g-fFD8sfxG", "typ": "JWT", "alg": "RS256", "jwk": { "kty": "RSA", "e": "AQAB", "kid": "ed2Nf8sb-sD6ng0-scs5390g-fFD8sfxG", "n": "yy1wpYmffgXBxhAUJzHHocCuJolwDqql75ZWuCQ_cb33K2vh9m" } }`

#### Public and private keys

In case you're not familiar with the terms "public key" and "private key", we've covered this as part of our materials on algorithm confusion attacks. For more information, see [Symmetric vs asymmetric algorithms](https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt/algorithm-confusion#symmetric-vs-asymmetric-algorithms).

Ideally, servers should only use a limited whitelist of public keys to verify JWT signatures. However, misconfigured servers sometimes use any key that's embedded in the `jwk` parameter.

You can exploit this behavior by signing a modified JWT using your own RSA private key, then embedding the matching public key in the `jwk` header.

Although you can manually add or modify the `jwk` parameter in Burp, the [JWT Editor extension](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/26aaa5ded2f74beea19e2ed8345a93dd) provides a useful feature to help you test for this vulnerability:

1. With the extension loaded, in Burp's main tab bar, go to the **JWT Editor Keys** tab.
    
2. [Generate a new RSA key.](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/testing-workflow/session-management/jwts#adding-a-jwt-signing-key)
    
3. Send a request containing a JWT to Burp Repeater.
    
4. In the message editor, switch to the extension-generated **JSON Web Token** tab and [modify](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/testing-workflow/session-management/jwts#editing-jwts) the token's payload however you like.
    
5. Click **Attack**, then select **Embedded JWK**. When prompted, select your newly generated RSA key.
    
6. Send the request to test how the server responds.
    

You can also perform this attack manually by adding the `jwk` header yourself. However, you may also need to update the JWT's `kid` header parameter to match the `kid` of the embedded key. The extension's built-in attack takes care of this step for you.
