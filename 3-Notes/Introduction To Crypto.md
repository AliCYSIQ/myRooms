ASC II is 7-bit encoding let you representation of text using integers
and you can use `chr()` in python to do this and use `ord()` to do opposite 
_____________
you can use` byte.fromhex()` to convert hex to bytes and use `.hex()` to do the opposite
and you can use this then use `base64` which allows us to represent binary data as an ASCII string using an alphabet of 64 characters by this code `base64.b64encode` and `base64.b64decode`
_____
`from Crypto.Util.number import *` from this library you can use `long_to_bytes()`  or `long_to_bytes()`  like if you number like this 
`1151519506386231889993168548881374739577551628728968263649996528271463725`
you need to use `long_to_bytes()` to convert it to normal strings 
_______________
XOR is a bitwise operator which returns 0 if the bits are the same, and 1 otherwise. In textbooks the XOR operator is denoted by âŠ•, but in most challenges and programming languages you will see the caret `^` used instead.

`0110 ^ 1010 = 1100`
  

| A   | B   | Output |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| 0   | 0   | 0      |
| 0   | 1   | 1      |
| 1   | 0   | 1      |
| 1   | 1   | 0      |
