what i knew from it , is:
1. sql stands for Structured Query Language
2. the most fame bug is injection
3. http on p 80, https on p 443
4. if the page not found , the response will be `404`
5. in `gobuster` tool there's two modes one for directory and the other one for subdomain , to choose directory more you should `gobuster dir ...` this the way
6. in MySQL if you want to add comment you can do this by add **`#`** then the comment to use this in real-world like in log-in , sometimes it will like this                                                `name=admin&password=1234456` you can change this and let it like this             
   `name=admin'#&password=1234456` now this will let you log in without checking the password                  **if the username exist**
