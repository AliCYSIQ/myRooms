## What is OAuth?

OAuth is a commonly used authorization framework that enables websites and web applications to request limited access to a user's account on another application. Crucially, OAuth allows the user to grant this access without exposing their login credentials to the requesting application. This means users can fine-tune which data they want to share rather than having to hand over full control of their account to a third party.
