**A race condition.** is a situation in computer programs where the timing of events influences the behaviour and outcome of the program. It typically happens when a variable gets accessed and modified by multiple threads. Due to a lack of proper lock mechanisms and synchronization between the different threads, an attacker might abuse the system and apply a discount multiple times or make money transactions beyond their balance.
